                <p class="maintext">I am writing to express my interest in the XXX position at XXX, as advertised. I
                    recently completed a comprehensive one-year IT program at GoIT, where I acquired proficiency in
                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. Additionally, I gained valuable experience working

                <p class="maintext">Throughout my time at GoIT, I took on roles that required effective communication,
                    problem-solving, and resourceful research skills. Whether working as part of a team or
                    independently, I demonstrated adaptability and a proactive approach to challenges. My experience has
                    equipped me with the skills necessary to contribute to the success of your high-performing
                    organization.</p>
                <p class="maintext">I am confident that my technical skills and positive work ethic make me a strong
                    candidate for this position. I am eager to bring my determination and drive to your team and
                    contribute to the continued success of your organization.</p>
                <p class="maintext">I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my internship experience has prepared
                    me for the challenges of this role in more detail. Please feel free to contact me at your earliest
                    convenience to schedule a conversation that suits your availability. Thank you for considering my
                    application.</p> <br>
